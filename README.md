# 🌐 rtfw-webapp-sample-rs

A simple rust webapp built on top of [rtfw-http](https://github.com/RTFW-rs/rtfw-http-rs).
It's got four main routes:
- `/paste` for note sharing
- `/send` for file upload/download
- `/mirror` to easily inspect how the server parses the HTTP request
- `/sleep` to test the multithreading aspect of the server
